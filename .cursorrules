- Always refer to Scratchpad before planning the next step.

## Lessons

### Phase 1 Learnings
- MCP SDK v0.4.0 has different API than newer examples online
- Server constructor requires single argument in v0.4.0, not two separate objects
- TypeScript strict mode causes issues with current MCP SDK - use relaxed settings for testing
- Simple MCP server works correctly - Phase 1 foundation is solid

### Phase 2 Learnings
- Azure OpenAI SDK uses OpenAIClient and AzureKeyCredential, not OpenAIApi and Configuration
- Google Calendar API integration requires proper OAuth 2.0 flow setup
- MCP server successfully integrates with external services (Google Calendar + Azure AI)
- Type filtering required for busy times from Google Calendar API
- All 8 calendar tools implemented: events, availability, slots, create, update, cancel, summary, parse
- Natural language processing integrated with calendar operations successfully

### OAuth Authentication Issues
- Google Cloud Console projects in testing mode require test users to be explicitly added
- Error 403 "access_denied" occurs when user is not in test users list
- Solution: Add user email to OAuth consent screen test users section
- Development apps show "unsafe app" warnings - normal behavior during testing phase

### Phase 3 Learnings
- Enhanced date parsing requires comprehensive relative date pattern matching
- Google Calendar events can have either dateTime or date properties (timed vs all-day)
- User preference learning improves scheduling recommendations over time
- Context-aware parsing significantly improves intent recognition accuracy
- Smart suggestions enhance user experience by anticipating needs
- Modular service architecture can create TypeScript conflicts - prefer extending existing services
- Phase 3 EmailSchedulerService successfully orchestrates email-to-calendar workflow with AI analysis
- Azure AI enhanced prompts provide comprehensive scheduling intent detection with 80%+ confidence
- Natural language date parsing with chrono-node library integrates seamlessly with scheduling analysis
- Mock implementations allow full testing of complex AI workflows without external dependencies
- Batch email processing enables efficient handling of multiple scheduling requests simultaneously
- Suggested actions framework provides intelligent next-step recommendations for scheduling workflows
- TypeScript strict compilation issues can be bypassed temporarily for rapid prototyping and testing
- High Priority Integration Fixes: MCP server constructor calls, EmailMonitorService Azure AI method calls, and real calendar integration are all working correctly
- GoogleCalendarService and GmailService constructors require clientId, clientSecret, redirectUri, and logger parameters
- EmailMonitorService should call azureAIService.analyzeEmailForScheduling() instead of having its own method
- MCP Server constructor expects single object with capabilities, not two separate objects
- Attendees array in calendar events must be objects with email property, not strings

### Phase 4 Learnings
- Advanced MCP tools require comprehensive helper method implementations
- Semantic search and AI-powered analytics significantly enhance user experience
- Conflict detection and resolution provide essential scheduling intelligence
- Productivity scoring algorithms help users optimize their calendar management
- End-to-end scheduling workflows reduce friction in meeting coordination
- TypeScript compilation benefits from removing conflicting duplicate services

### MCP Communication Resolution
- MCP server initialization timeouts were caused by incorrect message detection patterns
- MCP client should wait for server output with fallback timeout of 3-5 seconds
- Proper stdin/stdout communication requires careful JSON parsing and error handling
- Calendar API should use MCP process_natural_query tool for all intelligent operations
- GPT-4 through MCP can successfully analyze calendar queries and create intelligent responses
- MCP architecture allows AI to decide which tools to call based on user intent
- Real calendar integration works correctly when MCP client-server communication is fixed
- Frontend React components need null checks and compatible API response handling for MCP format
- Frontend must parse complex MCP response objects with nested content arrays correctly
- Frontend was only showing generic AI messages but not extracting actual calendar data from nested JSON
- Proper frontend parsing extracts events, time slots, insights, and suggestions from MCP response.data
- MCP server compilation issues can be temporarily bypassed for core service development and testing

## Scratchpad

### WANTED WORKFLOW (Target Architecture)

1. USER: "Do I have any meetings tomorrow afternoon?"

2. CLAUDE: 
   - Understands: need to get calendar events
   - Calculates: tomorrow afternoon = 2024-01-16T12:00:00Z to 2024-01-16T17:00:00Z
   - Calls MCP: get_calendar_events(timeMin, timeMax)

3. MCP SERVER:
   - Validates inputs
   - Calls Google Calendar API with proper auth
   - Gets raw event data
   - Transforms to clean format
   - Returns to Claude

4. CLAUDE:
   - Receives event list
   - Analyzes: "You have 2 meetings - Team standup at 1pm and Client call at 3pm"
   - Formats human-friendly response

5. FRONTEND:
   - Displays Claude's response to user
